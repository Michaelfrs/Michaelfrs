- 👋 Hi, I’m @Michael
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a developer and learning as much as I can in this field. I recently had this interest sparked and became intrigued by the amount of things you could create using Pyhton.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to develop programs using Python. I am fairly new and have barely scratched the surface. I am also in a degree program for IT with a focus on programming and development. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on meaningful projects. I have a few ideas of projects for public service departments. This comes from my current career as a Firefighter.
- 📫 You can reach me at pyprdevelopment@gmail.com
